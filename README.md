# Food-Waste-Reduction-Tracker-and-Inventory-Management-

Food waste is a significant global environmental, social, and economic issue. To combat this problem, we propose the development of a web-based application that aims to reduce food waste by helping individuals and communities track, manage, and minimize their food waste. The application will empower users to become more conscious of their food consumption habits and make sustainable choices in their daily lives.

features:
Inventory Management

Users will be able to create a digital inventory of the food items they are buying. The app will allow manual entry of items or utilize barcode scanning technology for efficient inventory management. Moreover, the application can suggest expiration dates based on the item type, ensuring users are aware of approaching deadlines.
