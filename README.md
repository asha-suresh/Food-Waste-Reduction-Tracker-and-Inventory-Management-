# Food Management and Food Waste Reduction Tracker

Food waste is a significant global environmental, social, and economic issue. To combat this problem, we propose the development of a web-based application that aims to reduce food waste by helping individuals and communities track, manage, and minimize their food waste. The application will empower users to become more conscious of their food consumption habits and make sustainable choices in their daily lives.
